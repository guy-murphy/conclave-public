# `Conclave.Documentation.NuDoc`

This implementation is lifted from [NuDoc](https://github.com/clariuslabs/NuDoc)
on GitHub, and you can find out more information about it from:-

The project files were a bit messy with missing dependencies, so wouldn't
compile. I've brought the job lot over so I can tweak as I want.

To be crystal clear, this is the work of *Daniel Cazzulino's*, and you should
probably check out his blog. Thanks Daniel, it's appreciated.
